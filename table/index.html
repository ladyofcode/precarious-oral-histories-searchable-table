                <p>This database contains a list of precarious oral history collections in Victoria with information
                    about each collection that was reported to the Identifying Precarious Victorian Oral History
                    Collections Project between May–September 2025. Information about each listed collection was
                    supplied to the project by the collection holder (or their authorised representative).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This database raises awareness of the extent and condition of precarious oral history collections in
                    Victoria. We hope this will spark further initiatives that support precarious oral history
                    collections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Precarious collections are at risk of not surviving. There are many other oral history collections
                    in Victoria that have not been identified by this project and are not included in this database. If
                    you wish to assist in any future efforts to support precarious oral history collections, please <a

                    This database was created in late 2025 by the Identifying Precarious Victorian Oral History
