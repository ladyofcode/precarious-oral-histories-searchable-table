About half seem to be recorded presentations at the historical society meetings, not interviews. Some of the cassette tapes have dates and include the name of the speaker of interviewer/s but there is limited metadata available about the interview beyond the name of the speaker. \nIn addition, 20 digital mp3 recordings on USBs in a drawer in Heritage Centre staff room. File name includes the name of interviewee and year, sometimes full date. Some of the names are the same as on the cassette tapes.  The digital tapes seem to be mostly interviewed by a local history librarian and constitute a separate project to the majority of the cassette tapes by the South Melbourne and Port Melbourne historical society. Only two of the digital interviews have slates so the interviewer is mostly unknown.",

    "Any other information": "These tapes were found in an unmarked drawer in a locked 'Local History Room' in Port Melbourne Library/town Hall complex. The room suffered from dampness three years ago when the roof of the Town Hall roof collapsed. The next 6 months we'll be launching a 'digitisation station' for cassette tapes. This will be available to the public to convert cassettes from analogue to digital. We aim to make reasonable efforts to identify and contact rights holders before converting making oral histories accessible online e.g., through raising with three existing historical societies in Port Phillip, through library and historical society newsletters. the online catalogue will have takedown provisions. Then convert the tapes to digital and make them accessible on a new module Spydus Archives, which will be searchable on the public library catalogue. Work is being done on the development of a long-term digital preservation strategy and as advised by the IT team will require investment beyond the library’s existing capacity.\n \nThe launch and maintenance of an accessible digital collection requires: Dedicated staff time for rights clearance, metadata creation, and cataloguing, ongoing maintenance of digital files and public access systems as well as a sustainable model for curation and care of growing digital content. Without increased staff support or collaboration across Council departments (e.g. with Records, IT and state and national bodies, the risk of neglect or deterioration of the digital collection remains significant. As convenor of the Local Studies Special Interest Group, I am coordinating a professional visit to the State Library of Victoria’s Digitisation area in September. This visit aims to build sector knowledge around scalable and sustainable practices for community-based digitisation projects. Insights from this tour will inform local advocacy and planning."

    "Outputs created by collection holder": "Melbourne’s Living Museum of the West has drawn on its oral history collection across more than four decades of community-engaged practice. The collection has informed a wide range of outputs, including books, exhibitions, public programs, interpretive materials, and digital resources. It has also been accessed by external researchers, artists, and community groups for independent projects. Key examples inlcude \"The Lifeblood of Footscray: Working Lives at the Angliss Meatworks (1986),\" edited by Chris Healy, a publication developed directly from oral history interviews, and the Pipemakers Park Audio Trail, which features edited excerpts from interviews and is integrated into interpretive signage throughout Pipemakers Park in Maribyrnong. The Museum’s collection has also supported numerous artist-led and community history projects, many of which have generated pamphlets, audio works, and exhibitions. Given the community-driven nature of the Museum and the longstanding use of oral histories in its programming, the collection has been foundational to the Museum’s creative and historical output for more than forty years.",

The project also records the memories of the Yallourn Medical and Hospital Society, one of the first contributory health schemes to operate in Australia. In 1926 Dr James Moore Andrew took the position of the Society’s first resident medical officer and with his wife Catherine Dorothy Andrew established a family at Yallourn, practising at Yallourn Hospital and lived in Yallourn until his death in 1972. Twenty individual audio interviews were carried out with Yallourn workers and recorded in their homes along with photographs. These are now stored in mp3 audio files on Old Gippstown computers.",

Increased sense of pride in heritage and identification with that past, as well as increased sense of unity through knowledge of shared background \n5. Retention of resources within the community, with recordings being lodged in the Yallourn house at Old Gippstown and on the Old Gippstown buildings website, as well as at Moe and District Historical Society. This will strengthen the sense of ownership of the past and ensure ease of access by local residents and researchers.",

I attended an oral history workshop at Benga House, Heritage Hill Museum Dandenong to get some tips, bought the cassette tapes and borrowed a microphone from a friend plus a tape recorder with foot control for editing. I have original raw tapes plus edited ones used for the school's 125th Celebration where I set up listening posts in the school hall for people to listen to the recordings. I applied for funding to do more with the tapes, perhaps publish a book but no one was interested. However, I think the tapes are historically important and should be kept and made available for anyone interested and nowadays they need to be digital. I need help to digitise and also want to be sure they will be valued and looked after.",

At the time Mordialloc Primary was under threat of closure by the Kennett Government, I was told anything I did had to be 'cost negative' therefore I paid for all the cassettes, photographs, developing and photocopying etc."

A set of approximately 17 CD recordings of interviews with Linton residents or former residents, conducted as part of PhD research undertaken by LDHS President Jill Wheeler, in 2005 and 2006. Jill donated these recordings to the Historical Society after she completed her research.\n3. Approximately 12 audio-visual recordings on DVDs. These are recordings of talks given at LDHS 'History Nights' between 2012 and 2022. Speakers were all Linton residents or former residents, who outlined their particular family's history in Linton township and district, and recalled aspects of life in Linton as they were growing up.",

Apart from acknowledgement and commentary in historical recipe books by Chinese\nAustralians, these businesses are dismissed in a line or two whenever new culinary and general histories appear. Recorded as socially isolated and frequented by prostitutes, gamblers, drunks and other unrepresentative social groups, they are recorded as ‘uncomfortable’ places for respectable non-Chinese Melburnians to patronise. Despite almost continuous growth from the late nineteenth century, they do not gain currency until the 1950s when they come to the fore as part of the post-war socio-cultural and economic success story.",

It ran between 1985 and 1987 having grown out of a program called 'The History Show' which moved from 3RRR to 3CR during 1985. Time and Place was less academic in style and presentation than 'The History Show' and it included interviews with authors from a range of backgrounds, reviews of books and magazines, discussions of current issues in history education, archive and heritage preservation and short interviews connected with the oral history of places and sites in Melbourne. The quality of each show varied considerably but it allegedly out-rated ABC radio on a Monday night in the 9.00-9.30 time slot. The tapes are generally in good condition and some have been digitised. Aside from significant interviews the tapes also provide an insight into an aspect of public radio in Melbourne during the 1980s.",

I am unsure of how or if copyright is relevant as all the programmes are live broadcasts. Programmes were put together quickly each week and as this was live radio it captures a style of presentation that is lost when something is pre-recorded or presented as a podcast – or when one of the presenters is also not the show's producer. We had a deliberate focus to make the segments widely accessible and we often cited the old adage about radio being the theatre of the mind so we tried to avoid the style of broadcast that was a lecture on the radio."

Percy Leason, born in 1889, and in 1924 became Australia's highest-paid cartoonist. His Wiregrass series, based on the mythical town of Wiregrass, captured the essence of rural life in Australia during the twenties and thirties. This project aims to use his cartoons and story telling to engage with new audiences through a main street trail with people who may not necessarily engage with traditional art galleries and museums. NB This is a work in progress and I am still capturing stories. I hope to be finished by the end of the year, but I am trying to fit this around many other jobs and daily life.",

Of particular interest is this  historical recording from 1972 recorded by the ABC for a series called Heritage featuring 6 ecological regions of Australia which included the Little Desert National Park. The recording features a 45 minute interview with the 'three blind mice' and provides first hand insight into the passion of the locals in preserving the area for generations to come. The recording also features local environmentalists and local historian Les Blake, referencing the local links of poet John Shaw Nelson and the Lost in the Bush story. https://www.kaniva.org/uploads/1/3/8/2/138203694/heritage_abc_three_blind_mice_1972.m4a .\n Also of interest is an interview recorded in 1995 with Laurie Rogers as wood merchant. We have linked to his interview through our Sheep painted in his memory. https://www.kaniva.org/laurie.html . \n Lastly, I was a founding member of the Purple Starfish and as part of our Heritage Wool Bale Stencil wall, former member Tom Curtis recorded oral histories of the sheep farmers. Unfortunately, the collection can not be located. I have personally searched for this which I remember being saved onto floppy disc at the time."

This movement for justice, which now includes 50 community legal centres across the state, began in the 1970s, when a small group of forward-thinking lawyers established the first community legal centre in Victoria, in an effort to address unmet legal need and to create an organisation through which they could advocate for just and fair laws. Last year, we invited some of the founding members of the sector/movement to speak freely about that time and their experiences in the nascent years of the community legal sector. The conversation was chaired by Jon Faine AM, who spent time working in community legal centres in the early 80s. The conversation lasted one hour and the audio was recorded.",

We try to work with students from the P12 school when we can. We do lots of research for people which brings in a little money but is very time consuming. Internet has made people research from home. Privacy rules are a bit of an issue. We have a segment from a century ago in our local paper which we began during Covid. \nWe are not able to go to seminars etc in Melbourne so rely on online sessions. \nWe try to have new themed displays for our town festival each year, occasional Open days and open by appointment.",

Each year the museum has relied on the generosity of local organisations to provide a venue for its AGM, as the museum itself is too small for that purpose. It is relatively unusual for the AGMs to be recorded. In this instance Simon Braid of Le Pine Eltham offered the use of the recording facility already setup at the venue. The video is a snapshot of the business of the Andrew Ross Museum at a particular moment in history. The meeting was hosted by outgoing President John Austin and incoming president Warwick Leeson, with Guest Speaker Mick Woiwod (author of several local history books).",

Some of the cassette tapes have dates and include the name of the speaker of interviewer/s but there is limited metadata available about the interview beyond the name of the speaker. \nIn addition, 20 digital mp3 recordings on USBs in a drawer in Heritage Centre staff room. File name includes the name of interviewee and year, sometimes full date. Some of the names are the same as on the cassette tapes.  The digital tapes seem to be mostly interviewed by a local history librarian and constitute a separate project to the majority of the cassette tapes by the South Melbourne and Port Melbourne historical society. Only two of the digital interviews have slates so the interviewer is mostly unknown."

The project also records the memories of the Yallourn Medical and Hospital Society, one of the first contributory health schemes to operate in Australia. In 1926 Dr James Moore Andrew took the position of the Society’s first resident medical officer and with his wife Catherine Dorothy Andrew established a family at Yallourn, practising at Yallourn Hospital and lived in Yallourn until his death in 1972. Twenty individual audio interviews were carried out with Yallourn workers and recorded in their homes along with photographs. These are now stored in mp3 audio files on Old Gippstown computers."

Apart from acknowledgement and commentary in historical recipe books by Chinese\nAustralians, these businesses are dismissed in a line or two whenever new culinary and general histories appear. Recorded as socially isolated and frequented by prostitutes, gamblers, drunks and other unrepresentative social groups, they are recorded as ‘uncomfortable’ places for respectable non-Chinese Melburnians to patronise. Despite almost continuous growth from the late nineteenth century, they do not gain currency until the 1950s when they come to the fore as part of the post-war socio-cultural and economic success story."

    "description": "The collection is a series of cassette recordings of a 30 minute program called 'Time and Place' that went to air on a Monday night between 9.00 and 9.30 on Radio 3RRR. It ran between 1985 and 1987 having grown out of a program called 'The History Show' which moved from 3RRR to 3CR during 1985. Time and Place was less academic in style and presentation than 'The History Show' and it included interviews with authors from a range of backgrounds, reviews of books and magazines, discussions of current issues in history education, archive and heritage preservation and short interviews connected with the oral history of places and sites in Melbourne. The quality of each show varied considerably but it allegedly out-rated ABC radio on a Monday night in the 9.00-9.30 time slot. The tapes are generally in good condition and some have been digitised. Aside from significant interviews the tapes also provide an insight into an aspect of public radio in Melbourne during the 1980s."

This movement for justice, which now includes 50 community legal centres across the state, began in the 1970s, when a small group of forward-thinking lawyers established the first community legal centre in Victoria, in an effort to address unmet legal need and to create an organisation through which they could advocate for just and fair laws. Last year, we invited some of the founding members of the sector/movement to speak freely about that time and their experiences in the nascent years of the community legal sector. The conversation was chaired by Jon Faine AM, who spent time working in community legal centres in the early 80s. The conversation lasted one hour and the audio was recorded."

Each year the museum has relied on the generosity of local organisations to provide a venue for its AGM, as the museum itself is too small for that purpose. It is relatively unusual for the AGMs to be recorded. In this instance Simon Braid of Le Pine Eltham offered the use of the recording facility already setup at the venue. The video is a snapshot of the business of the Andrew Ross Museum at a particular moment in history. The meeting was hosted by outgoing President John Austin and incoming president Warwick Leeson, with Guest Speaker Mick Woiwod (author of several local history books)."
